# Movie Matters

### About 
Movie Matters is a movie review web application where users can view the latest movies and watch their trailers. Users can input reviews for each movie. 

This project initially followed a tutorial to create the Spring backend to connect to MongoDB, build REST APIs to create and get movies. The tutorial also guided the process of creating a React UI using Bootstrap and Material UI, as well as consuming server API via axios. 

### In Progress
- User authentication using social logins (i.e. GitHub, Google OAuth2.0)
- Retrieve a larger collection of movies from the Movie Database API 
- Allow users to update and delete their reviews
